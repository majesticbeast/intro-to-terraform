# Introduction

What is Terraform?

> HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in
> human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.

Or, put simply, its a tool that allows you to write configuration code (HCL) to create infrastructure. However, it's
much more than that, because in reality, Terraform is just a wrapper around any API. This can be your local system,
Docker, GitHub, Domino's Pizza, AWS/GCP/Azure. Literally, anything that has an API, can in theory have a Terraform
wrapper.
